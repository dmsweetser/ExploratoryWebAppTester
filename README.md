# Exploratory Web App Tester

The Exploratory Web App Tester is a python script that automatically interacts with your site via Selenium with a goal of generating Javascript errors.

As it goes, it generates Python scripts for each set of steps, so they can be reused later on.

Its goal is to generate Javascript errors on the page. The longer it takes to get there, the higher reward.

Ideally, this script can be used to generate complete regression test suites automatically for your application.

It was tested with Python 3.7, Windows 10 and Chrome 117.
